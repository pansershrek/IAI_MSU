       "QueryResponse(points=[ScoredPoint(id=10014276148, version=4019, score=0.91350555, payload={'text': 'Geralt of Rivia () is a fictional character and the protagonist of The Witcher series of short stories and novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. He is a magically enhanced monster-hunter known as a \"witcher\", who possesses supernatural abilities due to his mutations. \\n\\nGeralt of Rivia is also the protagonist in CD Projekt Red\\'s series of video games based on The Witcher. In television adaptations, he was portrayed by Michał Żebrowski in The Hexer film and television series, while Henry Cavill portrays the character in the first three seasons of Netflix\\'s The Witcher television series, with Tristan Ruggeri portraying a young Geralt in the first season, and Liam Hemsworth due to take over the role from the fourth season onward.\\n\\nFictional biography\\n\\nNovels\\n\\nGeralt is a witcher, a magical mutant made for hunting and killing monsters. Shortly after being born, Geralt\\'s mother, Visenna, gives him away to undergo training and, eventually, become a witcher at the School of the Wolf at Kaer Morhen – the stronghold of the Wolven school witchers. His mentor and father figure there was a wise man and warrior named Vesemir. Geralt survives mutations during the Trial of the Grasses, thanks to which he gains various witcher traits: high resistance to injury, poison, and diseases, as well as slowed aging. Uniquely, Geralt had an unusual tolerance for the trials and was subjected to experimental mutagens as a result. Due to this, it caused the loss of all body pigmentation, leaving him with pale skin and white hair, which is the reason why he is referred to as Gwynbleidd in the Elder speech (close to the Welsh translation \"Blaidd Gwyn\"), meaning \"The White Wolf\".\\n\\nDespite his name, Geralt does not come from Rivia. Geralt received his training as a witcher in Kaer Morhen, which is located in Kaedwen and that is where he may actually be from. He added \"of Rivia\" to his name as he began work as a witcher, under advice from Vesemir that folk would be more trusting of him if he had a surname. Years later, he helped Queen Meve of Lyria and Rivia during an important battle, after which she knighted him, officially bestowing on him the title Geralt of Rivia.\\n\\nAfter completing his witcher training, he receives his Wolf medallion (the symbol of Kaer Morhen) and embarks into the world on his horse called Płotka (literally, \"Roach\" ; he gives the same name to every horse he owns) to become a monster slayer for hire.\\n\\nEven though Geralt does not believe in destiny, he unknowingly demands the unborn child of princess Pavetta and her husband Duny as a reward for his services by invoking \"the Law of Surprise\". The child turns out to be a girl, Cirilla, commonly known as Ciri; since then the two are linked to each other. At first, Geralt does not take her because traditionally women were not witchers. However, fate causes Geralt and Ciri to cross their paths twice, with him claiming her for a second time when he invokes the Law of Surprise on a traveling merchant he saves from monsters during a random encounter. Geralt ends up taking the girl into his care, becoming her mentor, training and loving her as his own daughter.\\n\\nFollowing the short stories, the novels unfold as Geralt is pulled into a whirlwind of events in his attempts to protect Ciri from those who would do her harm, becoming reluctantly embroiled in the political contentions of monarchs and emperors.\\n\\nReception \\n\\nPéter Apor described Geralt as being emblematic of Polish popular culture\\'s spirit of \"neo-liberal anti-politics\" in the 1990s. He is a professional, carrying out his duties and unwilling to become involved in the \"petty quarrels\" of contemporary politics. Sapkowski has stated that he personally abhors politics and considers his books to be politically neutral.  (née Materska at that time) compared Geralt to Raymond Chandler\\'s signature character Philip Marlowe. Dawid Matuszek discussed the gender and sexuality of Geralt, arguing that while Geralt has many obvious masculine characteristics, a deeper analysis also finds elements of feminine traits in his character.\\n\\nIn 2018, GamesRadar ranked Geralt as the 6th best hero in video game history. In 2018, he was included in Tom\\'s Guide Top 25 Best Video Game Characters of All Time.\\n\\nIn other media\\n\\nFilm and television\\nMichał Żebrowski portrays Geralt in the 2001 Polish film adaptation, The Hexer, and the television series of the same name that followed in 2002. Żebrowski also provides the dub voice of Cavill\\'s Geralt in the Polish-language dub of Netflix\\'s TV adaptation.\\n\\nHenry Cavill portrays Geralt in the Netflix television series The Witcher, the first season of which was released in December 2019. Sapkowski served as a creative consultant on the project. Starting with season 4, the role will be recast, with Liam Hemsworth portraying Geralt. Tristan Ruggeri appears in flashbacks as a younger Geralt.\\n\\nThe character of Geralt was dubbed by the following voice actors: Michał Żebrowski (Polish), Jiří Dvořák (Czech), Alexander Doering (German), Pepe Vilchis (Latin Spanish), Guillermo Romero (Spanish), Adrien Antoine (French), Pawan Kalra (Hindi), Welker Gábor (Hungarian), Gianfranco Miranda (Italian), Hiroki Tōchi (Japanese), Guilherme Briggs (Brazilian Portuguese), Sergey Ponomarev (Russian), Krin Aksorndee (Thai) and Rıza Karaağaçlı (Turkish).\\n\\nIn The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf animated film, young Geralt was voiced by Harry Hissrich.\\n\\nVideo games\\n\\nGeralt\\'s adventures continue in a non-canonical version by CD Projekt Red\\'s video game trilogy (The Witcher, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt), where he is still alive. He is voiced by Jacek Rozenek in Polish and Doug Cockle in English.\\n\\nThe third installment of the trilogy, like its predecessors, follows Geralt through his final adventures. Following the events of Witcher 2, Geralt has regained his memory of the past and prepares to embark on a new journey. In the Witcher 3, Geralt is on the hunt for the only person he considers kin, Ciri. Along his journey, Geralt must face the Wild Hunt in order to protect the people he cares about. In the new open world, Geralt has the opportunity to complete quests that are both part of the main story and side quests. He will also interact with old friends Dandelion and Vesemir along with potential lovers Triss Merigold and Yennefer.\\n\\nSapkowski stated that the games are a work of art of their own and that they cannot be considered either an \"alternative version\", or a sequel, \"because this can only be told by Geralt\\'s creator. A certain Andrzej Sapkowski.\"\\n\\nGeralt, voiced by Cockle, appeared as a guest character in the 2018 game Soulcalibur VI. He also appeared in special content for Monster Hunter: World and Daemon X Machina.\\n\\nGeralt appeared as the secret skin of Fortnite Battle Royale\\'s Chapter 4 Season 1 Battle Pass.\\n\\nCommemoration\\n\\nIn 2018, one of the city squares in Sapkowski\\'s hometown of Łódź was named in honour of Geralt of Rivia to celebrate the author\\'s 70th birthday.\\n\\nIn 2019, the Mint of Gdańsk produced a series of collector coins in collaboration with Andrzej Sapkowski. The first coin in the series was based thematically on the short story collection The Last Wish and features Geralt of Rivia. The issue of each subsequent coin corresponds to successive volumes of stories from the Witcher Saga.\\n\\nIn October 2021, a mural of Geralt was painted on the side of a high-rise building in Łódź. Spanning three 70-meter-high walls on a 26-floor apartment block and covering almost 2,000 sq/m, it is the largest mural in Poland and one of the largest in the world. The mural has been inspired by an 1818 painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog by German Romantic-era artist Caspar David Friedrich.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n List of characters in The Witcher series\\n Reynevan\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nThe Witcher\\nCharacters in fantasy novel series\\nFantasy video game characters\\nFantasy film characters\\nLiterary characters introduced in 1986\\nTelevision characters introduced in 2019\\nFictional characters who use magic\\nFictional characters with accelerated healing\\nFictional characters with albinism\\nFictional characters with superhuman strength\\nFictional knights\\nFictional mutants\\nFictional bounty hunters\\nFictional monster hunters\\nFictional swordfighters in literature\\nFictional characters with slowed ageing', 'my_metadata': {'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geralt%20of%20Rivia', 'title': 'Geralt of Rivia'}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None), ScoredPoint(id=10045249226, version=35071, score=0.8401985, payload={'text': 'Doug Cockle is an American actor and director.

The series revolves around the eponymous \"witcher\", Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski\\'s works, \"witchers\" are beast hunters who are given supernatural abilities at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters. The Witcher began with a titular 1986 short story that Sapkowski entered into a competition held by Fantastyka magazine, marking his debut as an author. Due to reader demand, Sapkowski wrote 14 more stories before starting a series of novels in 1994. Known as The Witcher Saga, he wrote one book a year until the fifth and final installment in 1999. A standalone prequel novel, Season of Storms, was published in 2013.\\n\\nThe books have been described as having a cult following in Poland and Central and Eastern European countries. They have been translated into 37 languages and sold over 15 million copies worldwide as of December 2019. They have also been adapted into a film (The Hexer), two television series (The Hexer and The Witcher), a video game series, and a series of comic books. The video games have been even more successful, with more than 50 million copies sold as of May 2020.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nProduction\\n\\nShort stories\\n\\nIn 1985, Andrzej Sapkowski was a 38-year-old traveling fur salesman with an economics degree and a love of fantasy literature. He decided to enter a short story competition, limited to 30-pages, held by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine Fantastyka. He did so at the urging of his son Krzysztof, who was an avid reader of the magazine. Sapkowski submitted \"The Witcher\" (1986), which was conceived as a retelling of a Polish fairy tale where a princess turned into a monster as punishment for the incest of her parents. He had to wait about a year for the results of the contest, and came in third place. Sapkowski felt that his work was the best in the competition, but the jurors relegated it to third because fantasy was considered to be for children at the time in Poland. However, reaction from readers was overwhelmingly positive and Sapkowski wrote more stories, about one or two a year, in response to their demand.\\n\\nHe based \"A Question of Price\" (and later \"Sword of Destiny\") on the universally known fairy tale in which a monster or sorcerer saves somebody\\'s life and then demands payment. The first four stories dealing with the witcher Geralt of Rivia were collected into a 1990 short story collection titled The Witcher — now out of print — by publisher Reporter. It includes 1988\\'s \"The Road with No Return\" (\"Droga, z której się nie wraca\"), which is set before The Witcher stories and features Geralt\\'s mother-to-be.\\n\\nAfter what he called a chance meeting, Sapkowski made a deal in 1990 with SuperNowa to publish the series. They released the second short story collection, Sword of Destiny, in 1992. The Last Wish was published by SuperNowa in 1993 to replace The Witcher as the first book, and includes all of its stories except \"The Road with No Return\" (the only story without Geralt). Although new short stories were also added to The Last Wish, they chronologically take place before those in Sword of Destiny.\\n\\n\"Something Ends, Something Begins\" (\"Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna\") is an alternate ending to The Witcher Saga about Geralt and Yennefer\\'s wedding that was written in 1992 as a wedding gift for Sapkowski\\'s friends. It and \"The Road with No Return\" are included in some Polish editions of The Last Wish or Sword of Destiny.\\n\\nThe Witcher Saga and Season of Storms\\nWith the positive reader reception to his short stories, Sapkowski decided to write a fantasy saga. He claimed that Polish publishers at the time believed only Anglo-Saxon fantasy authors were worth publishing and that Polish writers of the genre were too risky. SuperNowa were the only publisher willing to take the risk, and \"Now everybody envies\" them. For the saga, the author expanded on the story he used for \"A Question of Price\" and \"Sword of Destiny\". Blood of Elves, the first novel in The Witcher Saga, was published in 1994. The story focuses on Geralt of Rivia and Ciri, who are linked by destiny. Ciri, princess of a recently conquered country and a pawn of international politics, becomes a witcher-in-training. Geralt is drawn into a whirlwind of events in his attempts to protect her.\\n\\nThree more novels quickly followed at a pace of one a year; Time of Contempt (1995), Baptism of Fire (1996), and The Tower of the Swallow (1997). The fifth and final installment, The Lady of the Lake, was published in 1999.\\n\\nAfter 14 years, Sapkowski released Season of Storms in 2013. Set between short stories included in The Last Wish, it is a standalone prequel to The Witcher Saga. In 2020, Sapkowski stated that he had \"some plans\" for a new entry in The Witcher, but \"My future plans are vague, nothing is fixed yet\".\\n\\nNon-Witcher anthologies\\nCoś się kończy, coś się zaczyna (Something Ends, Something Begins) is a 2000 collection of short stories by Sapkowski, including two from The Witcher: \"The Road with No Return\" and \"Something Ends, Something Begins\". Published in 2012, Maladie i inne opowiadania (Maladie and Other Stories) is another Sapkowski short story collection that includes \"The Road with No Return\" and \"Something Ends, Something Begins\".\\n\\nChosen by Fate: Zajdel Award Winner Anthology is a 2000 English anthology by SuperNowa, in cooperation with the Silesian Club of Fantasy Literature, that includes a translation by Agnieszka Fulińska of \"The Witcher\" short story entitled \"The Hexer\". 2010\\'s A Polish Book of Monsters is an English anthology edited and translated by Michael Kandel that includes a translation of \"The Witcher\" entitled \"Spellmaker\". Maladie and Other Stories (not to be confused with the above Polish book of the same name) is a 2014 English e-book sampler with translations of \"The Witcher\", \"The Edge of the World\", and the first chapters of Blood of Elves and Baptism of Fire.\\n\\nSpin-offs\\nWith Sapkowski\\'s permission, the Polish publishing house Solaris published a collection of eight short stories entitled  (Tales from the World of The Witcher). Written by Russian and Ukrainian fantasy writers (including Andrei Belyanin and Vladimir Vasilyev), they are set in the world of The Witcher and feature its characters; \\nVasilyev story is part of his The Witcher of Grand Kiev universe. Szpony i kły (Claws and Fangs), a similar collection of eleven short stories by authors chosen through a 2016 competition by the Polish magazine Nowa Fantastyka, was published in 2017 by SuperNowa.\\n\\nSetting\\nWhen he first created The Witcher, Sapkowski had not thought up any background on the world of the series, \"I began with short stories; you don\\'t create universes in short stories, there is—literally and metaphorically—no place for them\". But when he switched to writing full novels, \"the necessity of some coherent background became imminent. And slowly, step by step, something resembling a universe started to emerge. But it\\'s only in the background, so it plays a secondary role in the story\". Although admitting to using Slavic mythology often due to it being \"very rich\" and abundant, Sapkowski said he does not have any preferred mythologies, folklores or bestiaries that he draws on for monsters in The Witcher; \"The story dictates the necessity. And, mostly, I put aside existing mythologies and invent something myself\". He said that the monsters in the series can be put into one of three categories. First, those that already \"exist\" with established names, appearances, habits and habitats, such as dragons. Second are those that he invents but gives names that can be found in nature, mostly insects because they are \"horrible and scary\". Third are those that are completely original creations, some of which are only named, because, \"When it has no importance as far as the storyline is concerned whatsoever, why bother?\" The author has also stated that he personally abhors politics and considers his books to be politically neutral.\\n\\nBackground\\nThe stories are set on an unnamed Continent, which was settled several thousand years earlier by elves from overseas. When they arrived, the elves encountered gnomes and dwarves. After a war between the elves and dwarves, the dwarves retreated into the mountains, and the elves settled in the plains and forests. Human colonists arrived about five hundred years before the events in the stories, igniting a series of wars. The humans were victorious and became dominant; the non-human races, now considered second-class citizens, often live in small ghettos within human settlements. Those not confined to the ghettos live in wilderness regions not yet claimed by humans. Other races on the Continent are halflings and dryads; werewolves and vampires appeared after a magical event known as the Conjunction of the Spheres.\\n\\nDuring the centuries preceding the stories, most of the Continent\\'s southern regions have been taken over by the Nilfgaard Empire; the north belongs to the fragmented Northern Kingdoms. The Witcher Saga takes place in the aftermath of the first major war between the Nilfgaard Empire and the Northern Kingdoms, with a second war beginning in the middle of the series.\\n\\nMajor characters\\n\\n Geralt of Rivia (Polish: Geralt z Rivii), also known as Gwynbleidd (Elder Speech: \"White Wolf\") and the Butcher of Blaviken, is the protagonist of the series and its adaptations, a witcher who travels the Continent and makes a living hunting monsters that plague the land. He is linked to Ciri by destiny. Kacper Pobłocki argues that he embodies the \"neo-liberal anti-politics\" spirit of the Polish popular culture of the 1990s. Geralt has been played by Michał Żebrowski in the Polish shows and movies. Currently he is played by Henry Cavill in the Netflix series The Witcher.\\n Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (known as \"Ciri\", from the name Zireael in Elder Speech (meaning \"Swallow\"; Polish: Jaskółka)), also known as the Lion Cub of Cintra, Child of the Elder Blood, Falka, and the Lady of Time and Space. Cirilla is the princess of Cintra, daughter of Pavetta and Duny (also known as the Urcheon of Erlenwald) and granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. She is also Geralt\\'s destiny and adopted daughter, and the focus of much of the plot. Ciri is a descendant of Lara Dorren and has the Elder blood, which gives her access to powers that allow her to cross space and time. Ciri has ashen grey hair and green emerald eyes, a trait that runs in her family. In the Polish 2002 film and 2002 TV series, she was played by .\\nYennefer of Vengerberg (Polish: Yennefer z Vengerbergu) first appeared in the collection of short stories, The Last Wish, featuring in the short story of the same name. She is a powerful sorceress, is a mother figure to Ciri, and becomes Geralt\\'s lover. As an avid reader of fantasy, Sapkowski said he was sometimes bored and disgusted with stories in which the hero could easily have sex with any woman he wished, so he created Yennefer to \"complicate things a little\" as a woman character who refuses to be a fantasy cliché. In the Polish 2002 film and 2002 TV series, she was played by Grażyna Wolszczak and by Anya Chalotra in the Netflix series.\\nDandelion (Polish: Jaskier) is a poet, minstrel, bard and Geralt\\'s best friend. The Polish word jaskier refers to the Buttercup flower (Ranunculus). Some of his more famous ballads were about the relationship between Geralt and Yennefer. By the time of the saga, he is already in his 40s though it is said that he appears to be in his 30s and is sometimes mistaken for an elf. He accompanies Geralt in many short stories and ends up joining his hansa while searching for Ciri. He is played by Joey Batey in The Witcher TV series. In the 2001 Polish Wiedźmin film, he was played by Zbigniew Zamachowski.\\nTriss Merigold is a sorceress and a friend of Geralt and Yennefer. She took care of Ciri for some time and is like an older sister to her. She was a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Triss is in love with Geralt. The image of Triss Merigold from The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings appeared as cover girl in the Polish edition of Playboy in May 2011. She also appeared in a live model calendar for the game in Russia.\\n\\nGeography\\nAlthough no map of the universe created by Sapkowski has been released, fans have created several maps. According to Sapkowski, the existing maps are \"mostly accurate\", and he uses a version created by Czech translator Stanislav Komárek.\\n\\nThe Continent can be divided into four regions. The Northern Kingdoms (where most of the saga occurs) consists of Aedirn, Cidaris, Cintra, Hengfors League, Kaedwen, Kerack, Kovir and Poviss, Lyria and Rivia, Redania, Temeria and Verden and several minor duchies and principalities such as Bremervoord or Ellander. The Nilfgaard Empire occupies most of the area south of the Northern Kingdoms. The eastern part of the Continent, such as the Korath desert, Zerrikania, Hakland and the Fiery Mountains, is mostly unknown. The book series mentions overseas countries with whom the Northern Kingdoms trade, including Zangvebar, Ofir, Hannu and Barsa.\\n\\nLanguage\\nSapkowski created a language for the series known as Elder Speech, based on Welsh, English, French, Irish, Latin and other languages. Dialects are spoken on the Skellige Islands and in Nilfgaard. In an interview, Sapkowski explained that he wanted the language to be reasonably legible to a reader, to avoid footnotes. As he said: \"In my book, I do not want for an orc telling to another orc \\'Burbatuluk grabataluk!\\' to be supplied with a footnote: \\'Shut the door, don\\'t let the flies in!\\'\"\\n\\nChronology\\n\\n\"The Road with No Return\" – untranslated\\n\"A Grain of Truth\"\\n\"The Lesser Evil\"\\n\"The Edge of the World\"\\n\"The Last Wish\"Season of Storms\"A Question of Price\"\\n\"The Witcher\"\\n\"The Voice of Reason\"\\n\"The Bounds of Reason\"\\n\"A Shard of Ice\"\\n\"Eternal Flame\"\\n\"A Little Sacrifice\"\\n\"Sword of Destiny\"\\n\"Something More\"Blood of ElvesTime of ContemptBaptism of FireThe Tower of the SwallowThe Lady of the LakeEpilogue to the Season of Storms\"Something Ends, Something Begins\" (alternative ending) – untranslated\\n\\nTranslations\\nThe stories and novels have been translated into 37 languages worldwide. Sapkowski denied having any involvement in the English translations, explaining, if the translator \"is polite enough, sometimes he asks me questions, sometimes he presents me with a fragment of the first page, but it is his own will – I have nothing to do with it\". When asked his opinion on the quality of the translation, the original author stated, \"We Poles, we say, \\'Translations are like women: if they are beautiful, they are not true; if they are true, they are not beautiful.\\' I speak some 15 languages so for me it\\'s very easy to read the translations and see if they are good or not. Sometimes it\\'s terrible; sometimes I\\'m very happy because the spirit, the spirit, is in the translation\".\\n\\nThe name \"Witcher\"\\n\\nSapkowski chose wiedźmin as the male equivalent of the Polish word for witch (wiedźma). In his book 2005 book-interview Historia i fantastyka, Sapkowski noted that the word \"witcher\" is a natural male version of the English word \"witch\", and implied that the similarity between those two words, as well as between the German terms, was the inspiration coining wiedźmin as a new Polish word. Polish video game designer Adrian Chmielarz claimed to have invented the translation of wiedźmin into English as witcher around 1996–1997.\\n\\nAlthough wiedźmin is now usually translated into English as \"witcher\", an earlier translation of the title was \"hexer\" (the title of the 2001 film adaptation and the first official English translation in the 2000 short story collection Chosen by Fate: Zajdel Award Winner Anthology); Hexe and Hexer are the German words for female and male \\'witch\\' respectively. CD Projekt used \"witcher\" for the title of its 2007 English release of the video game, and Danusia Stok used it in her translation of Ostatnie życzenie that was published the same year. Michael Kandel however used \"spellmaker\" in his 2010 translation of the \"Wiedźmin\" short story for A Book of Polish Monsters anthology.\\n\\nReceptionThe Witcher series has been described as having a cult following in Poland and Central and Eastern European countries. They have been translated into 37 languages and sold over 15 million copies worldwide as of December 2019. Two weeks after the Netflix TV adaptation was released in 2020, revenue from the books was reportedly up 562% compared to the same period in 2018. Entries in The Witcher series have earned Sapkowski the Janusz A. Zajdel Award three times; \"The Lesser Evil\" (1990), \"Sword of Destiny\" (1992), and Blood of Elves (1994). The Last Wish won the 2003 Premio Ignotus for Best Anthology in Spain. In the United Kingdom, Blood of Elves won Best Novel at the first David Gemmell Awards for Fantasy in 2009. Sword of Destiny won the 2012 Tähtifantasia Award in Finland.\\n\\nIn October 2018, Sapkowski\\'s hometown of Łódź officially renamed a garden square Witcher Square (Skwer Wiedźmina) and announced plans to add benches, swings and other installations based on the series to the area. In October 2021, a mural of Geralt was painted on the side of a skyscraper in Łódź. Spanning three 70-meter-high walls and covering almost 2,000 sq/m, it is the largest mural in Poland and one of the largest in the world.\\n\\nAdaptations\\nComic books\\nFrom 1993 to 1995, Sapkowski\\'s stories were adapted into six-issue comic books The Witcher by Maciej Parowski and Sapkowski (story), Bogusław Polch (art).\\nIn 2011, Egmont released a 2-part comic book, titled Reasons of State, containing an original story. It was written by Michał Gałek, illustrated by Arkadiusz Klimek, and colorized by Łukasz Poller.\\n\\nIn 2013, Dark Horse Comics announced a comic book series likewise called The Witcher, based on the video-game series and made in collaboration with CD Projekt Red. It began publishing in 2014. Most of the stories are based on original plots not written by Sapkowski, with different writers and artists working on different issues.\\n\\nIn October 2015, a one-shot webcomic titled Matters of Conscience was released by CD Projekt Red to expand on the events following their second video game.\\n\\n Video games \\n\\nIn 2007, a video game The Witcher developed by CD Projekt Red was released. A sequel, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, was released in 2011 by the same team. The final game of the trilogy, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, was released in 2015. Sapkowski had no involvement with the video games, giving the studio license to create a completely new story using his characters. All three games were positively received, with Metacritic giving them an 81, an 88, and a 93 out of 100 respectively. They were also extremely successful commercially, selling more than 50 million copies as of May 2020, over 30 million copies being from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt alone.\\n\\nCD Projekt Red developed a card game named \"Gwent\" that was included in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as an in-game activity.

It is the sequel to the 2007 game The Witcher and the second main installment in [[The Witcher (video game series)|The Witcher\\'\\'\\'s video game series]]. It was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, OS X, and Linux.\\n\\nThe player directs the actions of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher. The fantasy world in which his adventures take place owes much to Polish history and Slavic mythology.\\n\\nThe game was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 8 million copies by September 2014. The third installment in the series, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, was released in May 2015.\\n\\nGameplay\\n\\nThe gameplay of The Witcher 2 is a marked departure from that of its predecessor. Combat, for instance, is much more complex, with additions in the form of abilities to lay traps and aim and throw ranged weapons. The protagonist, Geralt, has an improved offensive and defensive arsenal, with a wide range of melee and ranged weapons, armor, bombs, traps, and secondary weapons such as hatchets and shovels. Upgrades are divided into four distinct paths: an initial training path, which includes generalized upgrades for various core abilities and must be invested in before the other paths can be accessed; swordsmanship, which improves Geralt\\'s sword-fighting abilities; alchemy, which includes perks such as reducing the negative effects of potions; and magic, which improves Witcher Signs.The Witcher\\xa02 includes a stealth mode in certain parts of the game, where players must remain undetected as they make their way to a certain objective. Players have the option of stunning enemies if Geralt manages to get behind them, but the player may choose to take a less subtle approach and engage the guards in combat.\\n\\nPlot\\n\\nStory\\nThe player controls Geralt of Rivia, who is one of the few remaining witchers – enhanced and trained humans with special powers who hunt monsters for a living. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings contains many different paths and storylines, along with multiple endings.\\n\\nPrologue\\nAt the start of the game, Geralt is in prison under suspicion of assassinating Foltest, the king of Temeria. The head of the Temerian special forces, Vernon Roche, interrogates Geralt and learns the story that led from Geralt being Foltest\\'s right-hand man to a prisoner. Prior to and during the events of The Witcher, Foltest had a secret relationship with a baroness named Maria Louisa La Valette, which led to two children, Anais and Boussy. Some time after Geralt saved Foltest from a witcher assassin (at the end of The Witcher), Foltest attempted to claim his children and bring them to live with him in Vizima. Maria was not willing to give up the children, and Foltest waged a war to claim them. Geralt succeeded in escorting Foltest to his children, but an unknown assailant kills Foltest before disappearing, leaving Geralt the only suspect. After the interrogation, Roche decides that Geralt is innocent and aids him in escaping the prison. The two, along with sorceress Triss Merigold, go in search of the kingslayer.\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nThe trio arrives in the trading town of Flotsam and is ambushed by Iorveth, a rebel elf. It appears to the group that a witcher, believed to have assassinated King Demavend of the neighboring country of Aedirn, is in league with the rebels. Geralt saves his old friends, the bard Dandelion and the dwarf Zoltan Chivay, from being hanged in the city square. With the help of sorceress Síle de Tansarville, Geralt kills a Kayran, a giant monster that is disrupting the town\\'s trade routes. Geralt discovers that Loredo, the ostensibly Temerian commander of the town, is intending to sell the town to King Henselt of Kaedwen. He also discovers that the kingslayer, a witcher known as Letho, means to betray Iorveth and convinces the elf of the truth. As Geralt and Iorveth confront Letho, Roche arrives with an armed force. The player chooses between assisting Iorveth or Roche, thus setting the path of the second chapter. Regardless of the choice, Letho kidnaps Triss and forces her to teleport both of them to Aedirn.\\n\\nChapter 2 (Iorveth)\\n\\nIf Geralt assists Iorveth, the pair sail to upper Aedirn. There, they become embroiled in a rebellion against King Henselt of neighboring Kaedwen, and they assist the rebel forces. Geralt completes three missions: formulating a poison antidote for rebel leader Saskia, determining Triss\\'s whereabouts (captured by spies from the empire of Nilfgaard and taken to Loc Muinne), and lifting a battlefield curse that is preventing the rebels from defending Vergen, the rebel\\'s base of operations. The rebels defeat King Henselt\\'s army, and Henselt is forced to acknowledge Saskia\\'s terms. Geralt discovers Saskia is a dragon taking human form, but she is under mind control by her advisor, the sorceress Philippa Eilhart. When Philippa teleports Saskia and herself to Loc Muinne, Geralt and Iorveth follow.\\n\\nChapter 2 (Roche)\\n\\nIf Geralt assists Roche, Roche has Geralt assassinate Loredo for treason. Geralt and Roche sail to upper Aedirn. There, they also become embroiled in the rebellion against King Henselt, but assist the king instead of fighting against him. Geralt discovers an insurgency in the Kaedweni army: loyalists who are convinced Henselt is conspiring with the empire of Nilfgaard. Geralt completes three missions: determining Triss\\'s whereabouts (captured by a diplomatic delegation from Nilfgaard and taken to Loc Muinne), lifting a curse on King Henselt, and lifting a battlefield curse that is preventing the king from marching on the city of Vergen. Geralt defends Henselt from two witcher assassins, and assists Dethmold, a mage and royal advisor to King Henselt, in a necromancy ritual to discover they are in league with Síle de Tansarville, who has already fled to Loc Muinne with fellow sorceress Philippa Eilhart and entranced rebel leader Saskia in tow. Roche is revealed to be plotting against Kaedwen, and Henselt executes most of Roche\\'s men in retaliation. As Henselt assaults Vergen, Geralt defeats Henselt\\'s personal guard, and either allows Roche to murder Henselt in revenge (which causes a civil war in Kaedwen) or convinces him to spare the king. Geralt and Roche then go to Loc Muinne, on the trail of Triss and Philippa.\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\nGeralt arrives at Loc Muinne with either Iorveth or Roche, depending on whom he assisted previously. The mages have called a meeting to establish a new magical ruling body known as the Conclave, and all royal leaders are at Loc Muinne. Philippa Eilhart and Síle de Tansarville intend to use the meeting to establish their own power, with the still-entranced Saskia as leverage.\\n\\nIf Geralt arrives with Iorveth, he must choose between rescuing Triss or rescuing Philippa, who is the only person capable of lifting the spell from Saskia but who was captured and blinded by the king of Redania. If Geralt arrives with Roche, he must choose between rescuing Triss or rescuing the kidnapped Princess Anais of Temeria. Depending on the choice, the mage-royal meeting is interrupted when Nilfgaardian forces arrive with Letho, who reveals the sorceresses\\' entire plot, or if Triss is rescued – regardless of whom Geralt assisted – she reveals the sorceresses\\' plot instead. The meeting is interrupted again by Saskia in dragon form, who is still under mind control by Philippa. Geralt chases down Síle, who attempts to use her megascope (a magical teleporter) to escape. However, Letho had sabotaged the megascope, in which Síle becomes stuck. Geralt can either rescue Síle or do nothing, in which case Síle is torn to bits. Finally, Geralt duels Saskia, after which he can kill her, let her live, or (if he rescued Phillipa earlier) break the spell over Saskia\\'s mind.\\n\\nEpilogue\\nIf Triss was rescued, the Conclave is restored and the mages work to seal Loc Muinne. If Triss was not rescued, a bloody pogrom of magic users occurs in Loc Muinne and throughout the Northern Kingdoms. Geralt finally confronts Letho, who reveals a Nilfgaardian plot to destabilize the Northern Kingdoms. After hearing Letho\\'s story, Geralt can either let him go or duel him to the death. Geralt then reunites with Triss and either Iorveth or Roche, and sets off south. A concurrent plot of the game is Geralt\\'s attempts to recover lost memories from his previous life, learning more about his beloved Yennefer, and the mythical Wild Hunt. The post-credit scene reveals a wood gathering peasant witnessing a Nilfgaardian invasion, setting the stage for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\\n\\nDevelopmentThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings was announced on 18 September 2009. CD Projekt Red developed a proprietary engine, the REDengine, for the game, unlike the first installment, which ran on a modified version of BioWare\\'s Aurora Engine. The game incorporates the Havok physics engine.The Witcher 2 features a branching dialogue system with full voice acting, which was cast, directed, and recorded in London, England. The developers said that the game would have 16 different endings, although that was later clarified as 16 \"states of the world\" by the game\\'s end. The game drew from influences such as Demon\\'s Souls, Heavy Rain, and Batman: Arkham Asylum.\\n\\nCD Projekt Red released the first gameplay video on 25 March 2011, showcasing different methods with which a player could complete a level. Another gameplay video was revealed at Gamescom 2011, displaying the game\\'s many characters and settings. An Xbox 360 version was announced on 2 June 2011, with CD Projekt Red confirming that it would be released by the end of the year. However, on 1 August 2011, the Xbox 360 release date was pushed back to the first quarter of 2012 to give the team \"more time expanding and polishing certain elements of the gameplay\" and to allow the developers time to deal with legal issues surrounding distribution rights for the game.\\n\\nRelease\\nDuring the game\\'s initial announcement, CD Projekt Red that their parent company CD Projekt would self-distribute the game in Poland, in addition to Central Europe. A contract with Agora S.A. was also announced to allow the company to co-produce the game in Poland. Distribution deals with Atari in North America and 1C Company/Snowball Studios in Russia were verified, while a European distribution plan was still under negotiations. On May 25, 2010, it was announced that Namco Bandai Partners would be the game\\'s distributor in Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East.\\n\\nOn 14 April 2011, CD Projekt Red announced during their CDP Days 2011 Spring Conference that retail copies of the game would feature SecuRom digital rights management (DRM). However, the protection would still allow for infinite installations on an infinite number of PCs, with the ability to play on up to five PCs at any one time. It was confirmed that the game would feature no censorship between regions. The Witcher 2 was also distributed through several digital distribution services such as Steam and CD Projekt Red\\'s own service GOG.com. The version sold on GOG.com was the only version that did not have any DRM at release.\\n\\nOn 3 May 2011, Namco Bandai Partners Australia confirmed that the Australian release of the game would be modified to meet the MA15+ rating. The edit specifically relates to a side quest in which Geralt is offered sex as a reward for completing the quest. The Australian version sees Geralt decline the offer automatically. Three weeks prior to this announcement, the game was removed from the Australian Steam store, causing outrage amongst the Australian gaming community. Additionally, CD Projekt Red\\'s digital distribution service GOG.com announced that the price of the Australian version would be increased due to licensing issues, but that customers could still pre-order the game for its original price 17 hours before the change.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings was released for PC on 17 May 2011 at retail stores and digital distribution services such as GOG and Steam.\\n\\nXbox 360 version\\nOn 30 June 2011, it was announced that THQ would be the distributor for the Xbox 360 version of the game for Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East instead of Namco Bandai Partners. On 8 July 2011, Namco Bandai sued CD Projekt, accusing CD Projekt of breaking its contractual obligations with the publisher. On 8 December 2011, Namco Bandai won the suit, and CD Projekt Red\\'s distribution agreement with THQ was canceled.\\n\\nOn October 21, 2011, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment signed as the North American distributor for the Xbox 360 version.\\n\\nUK supermarket chain Tesco released the Xbox 360 version of the game on Friday 13 April 2012 – four days ahead of the scheduled release date – and were asked to pull the game off the shelves until the original release date.\\n\\nSpike Chunsoft localised and published the Xbox 360 version in Japan.\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\nGOG promoted the game by reducing the price of The Witcher a week before the sequel\\'s release. They encouraged players to import their save files from the first game to the second. Steam offered three promotional The Witcher 2 items for Team Fortress\\xa02. These were a hat of hair, a sword, and a necklace, which were limited to the game\\'s Scout class. The May 2011 issue of the Polish version of Playboy featured the half-naked character Triss on the cover. In Russia, publishers 1C Company released a real-life nude calendar with copies of the game. When American President Barack Obama visited Poland in May 2011, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk gave him several gifts, including the Collector\\'s Edition of The Witcher 2.\\n\\nEnhanced Edition\\nOn 27 January 2012, CD Projekt Red announced an \"Enhanced Edition\" of The Witcher 2 via its sister company GOG.com. It was released on 17 April 2012 on the Xbox 360 and on Microsoft Windows via Steam and GOG.com. All existing owners of The Witcher 2 received free upgrades to the Enhanced Edition, and could pre-load the update starting 11 April 2012. All new copies on PC and Xbox 360 shipped with the additional content on board. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings - Enhanced Edition includes all content from the base game and added over 10GB of new content, including four hours of gameplay, arena mode, new tutorial, 36 minutes of cinematics including a new intro created by Platige Image and an outro, as well as a host of fixes to gameplay and the interface.\\n\\nReception\\n\\nCritical receptionThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings received generally favorable reviews. It has won over 50 awards for best graphics, best adaptation or use of a license, best story, best PC game, best RPG, and Game of the Year.\\n\\nCritics praised combat mechanics, customization, graphics, environments, immersion, and storytelling. PC Gamer felt that combat mechanics and the game\\'s ending were the weaker points of the game. 1UP\\'s Tom Chick gave the game a glowing \\'A\\' rating and cited its \"rich graphics that don\\'t have to be flashy, complex challenging combat, and superlative low-fantasy writing\". The game garnered some perfect scores, with GamePro saying that \"The Witcher 2 embodies everything that\\'s good about PC development, and everything that makes it, in my mind, the best platform out there.\" Game Informer gave the game a \"platinum score\" and mentioned that \"the brilliant dark fantasy adventure is just as good on console\" as it was on PC.\\n\\nA major source of contention about the game is the difficulty of the combat, especially during the game\\'s first few hours. Some sources such as Eurogamer have praised the difficulty of the prologue, explaining \"[the game] treats you not as a player\\xa0... but as an adult, free to make your own mistakes and suffer a plot in which not everyone gets what they deserve\".\\n\\nThe game was also criticized for what Rock, Paper, Shotgun characterized as gratuitous nudity, especially in the topless scene of the character Maria Louisa La Valette, who is said to show \"brazen breasts\" while being threatened with torture, her breasts sexualizing a scene that should be gravely serious. Other critics felt the scene was simply being realistic, in that a woman in the real world who is about to be tortured would probably have bare breasts.\\n\\nIn June 2014, the game garnered mainstream media coverage when United States President Barack Obama mentioned the video game in his speech in Poland. He said:\\n\\nSalesThe Witcher\\xa02 had reportedly sold more than 940,000 copies by August 2011, a sales rate that CD Projekt Red had projected. Of the 940,000 copies sold, 200,000 were online sales (digital sales).\\n\\nAdditional statistics for online sales were reported in November 2011. Direct2Drive, Impulse, and Gamersgate\\'s combined sales were a total of 10,000 units. GOG sold 40,000 copies. Within the same time period, 200,000 copies of The Witcher\\xa02 were sold on Steam.\\n\\nBy May 2012, the game had sold 1.7 million copies. By February 2013, the combined sales of the game and its predecessor exceeded 5 million. By March 2014, The Witcher series had sold 7 million copies of both games. By September 2014, the series reached 8 million copies.\\n\\nSequelThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\\'\\' was announced by CD Projekt Red on 5 February 2013, and was released on 19 May 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n2011 video games\\nAction role-playing video games\\nAtari games\\nBandai Namco games\\nVideo games about dragons\\nLinux games\\nMacOS games\\nSingle-player video games\\n2 Assassins of Kings\\nVideo game sequels\\nVideo games developed in Poland\\nVideo games with stereoscopic 3D graphics\\nVideo games with user-generated gameplay content\\nWarner Bros. video games\\nWindows games\\nXbox 360 games\\nCD Projekt games\\nVideo games using Havok\\nXbox One X enhanced games\\nXbox One games\\nVideo games scored by Marcin Przybyłowicz', 'my_metadata': {'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Witcher%202%3A%20Assassins%20of%20Kings', 'title': 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings'}}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None)])"
